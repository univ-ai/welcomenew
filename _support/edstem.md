## Why use edStem

edStem is going to be our main mode of teaching and testing. All the lectures, associated videos and exercises will be conducted through edStem.

## Navigating through edStem

Every exercise is well designed to ensure you can easily understand the task at hand. The entire page is divided into 3 parts. The leftmost part displays all the slides within the lesson. The middle section gives you all the necessary information to complete the exercise. The last part is where you enter your code. We have provided detailed comments and helper code. Once you fill in all the blanks with the appropriated code and are satisfied with your results, click on Mark at the bottom right corner. This will auto grade your exercise.
