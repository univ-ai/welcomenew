## What

Every person who does machine learning needs to understand its basic concepts: loss, minimization, 
training, testing, overfitting and regularization. We introduce all of these concepts in the context
of polynomial and logistic regression.

## Who

Rahul Dave

Rahul is co-founder of Univ.AI. He was previously a lecturer at Harvard University. He was on the original team for Harvardâ€™s famous Data Science course, cs109, and has taught machine learning, statistics, and AI courses, both at Harvard and at multiple conferences and workshops. Some of his more popular offerings have been the Data Scientist Training for Librarians workshops in Boston and Copenhagen, Machine Learning for Suits at the Open Data Science Conference, continuing versions of cs109, and the am207 course on Bayesian Statistics and Generative Models at Harvard. Rahul is an accomplished computational scientist with a strong programming background and a veteran cosmologist. His Ph.D. thesis in cosmology and astrophysics at the University of Pennsylvania involved both high performance computing and bayesian statistics, and was one of the first works introducing dark energy. His subsequent work in Solar System astronomy and large scale astronomy databases at the ADS took him in the direction of machine learning and AI. Rahul is passionate about teaching, and a big believer in exposing big, 'researchy' ideas early on, to students.

## Details

We'll cover:

- loss and mimimization of loss
- bias and variance, underfitting and overfitting
- training, testing, and validation sets, including cross-validation
- regularization as a different approach to complexity control
- classification using logistic regression
- the geometric interpretation of machine learning
