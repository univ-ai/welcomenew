Welcome to the **First Edition** of AI4-B. 

The objective of this module is to provide fundamental understanding of the concepts behind Generative Models and apply them to real world problems. This course follows the Univ.AI model of balancing between concept, theory, and implementation.

This course will give an overview of network building blocks, followed by an review of Generative Adversarial Networks and their applications. The course also touches on latent space interpretation. 

At the end of this module, you will be able to build effective generative adversarial networks.

This page introduces you to the team, the basic instructions, the schedule and various elements of our class.

## The Coursework


We have very carefully designed the coursework to give you, the student, a wholesome learning experience.

Each week shall include:

-  2 Sessions
-  2 Labs
-  Office hours

### Session - What to expect

![](/assets/images/Session.png)

Before the session begins, students are expected to complete a pre-class reading assignment and and attempt a quiz based on the same.

A session will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated three times:

- Approx. 15 minutes of live online instruction followed by approx 15 minutes of Q/A + Quiz + Exercises. 
- Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, 
  provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details. 
- Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques.

After the session, students are expected to complete a short post-class quiz based on the principal concepts covered in class.

### Lab - What to expect

![](/assets/images/Lab.png)

A lab is a TA driven one hour session that is divided into 3 major parts. 

- Each lab begins by revisiting the Quizzes and Exercises done in the previous lecture session. 
- After discussing exercises, we will have a semi-formal Q/A session. All doubts pertaining, but not limited, to the previous session, 
  and homeworks are welcome.

- The last part of the labs deals predominantly with the upcoming homeworks. It is 
  directed towards giving a brief overview of the homework problem. We will discuss some code to help you get started.

### Course Pre-Requisites 

Your are expected to have a working knowledge of python, along with these three libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Tensorflow.keras

All exercises in this course will be done in jupyter notebooks. 

> Note: Prior knowledge of high level machine learning libraries such as keras is necessary for this module


Before you begin the course, we have prepared for you a simple exercise to ensure your proficieny of the above libraries. 

This will help you assess your preparedness for the course, and will also help you familiarize yourself with the platform.

## Diversity & Inclusion

We actively seek and welcome people of diverse identities, from across the spectrum of disciplines and methods since Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly mediates our social, cultural, economic, and political interactions [1]. 

We believe in creating and maintaining an inclusive learning environment where all members feel safe, respected, and capable of producing their best work. 

We commit to an experience for all participants that is free from -- Harassment, bullying, and discrimination which includes but is not limited to:

- Offensive comments related to age, race, religion, creed, color, gender (including transgender/gender identity/gender expression), sexual orientation, medical condition, physical or intellectual disability, pregnancy, or medical conditions, national origin or ancestry.
- Intimidation, personal attacks, harassment, unnecessary disruption of talks during any of the learning activities.
