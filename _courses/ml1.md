## What

Any set of dots can be connected. The true distinction is if that connecting line is useful and meaningful. We will start with some of the common regression problems across few industries. We will then go in-depth into a real-life use case along with a dataset to understand regression better. We will get hands-on with codes, have fun creating features and compare them with benchmarks. We will discuss the pros and cons of some of these metrics. We will also discuss experimentation and how should the models be measured in production. Participants will also be given a hands-on problem to solve
