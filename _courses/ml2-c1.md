## What

lassification problems are possibly the most common problems in the industry today. Whether the problems exist as classification or not, they do get often converted to classification problems. We will first look at some of the easier and straightforward examples for classification. We will also see some of the ‘not-so classification-friendly’ problems but solved well-using classification mechanisms. Then we go depth into one of the binary class use-cases along with a dataset. We will solve it and spend time discussing metrics and measurements. We can briefly touch upon multi-class classification followed by metrics.
